# Restricted Multi-Epoch CKA Game (Auxiliary)

An auxiliary restricted multi-epoch CKA security game, inspired by Figure 3
of Alwen-Coretti-Dodis (2020) but NOT the paper-faithful adaptive oracle
model. The paper-faithful Figure 3 formalization is in `CKA/Figure3Game.lean`.

## How this differs from Figure 3

This game uses a **non-adaptive** adversary that commits to `t*`, epoch count,
and corruption requests upfront, then sees the full transcript before guessing.
It does NOT include:
- Adaptive oracle interaction
- Party-specific corruption oracles (`corr-A` / `corr-B` separately)
- Bad-randomness oracles (`send-P'(r)`)
- Per-party epoch counters or ping-pong turn discipline

## Purpose

This serves as an auxiliary intermediate formalization used for:
- `CKASecureDelta`: an auxiliary security notion for organizing intermediate
  proof steps (not the canonical Definition 13 formalization)
- `CKASecureDelta_implies_CKASecure`: bridge from multi-epoch to single-epoch

For the paper-faithful Definition 13 with adaptive oracles and Δ, see
`Figure3CKASecure` in `CKA/Figure3Game.lean`.

## Δ parameter semantics

`Δ_CKA` is the number of epochs after `t*` before the state can be safely
revealed. For DDH-CKA, `Δ = 1`: one fresh DH exchange after the challenge
epoch makes the state independent of the challenged key.

yet entered the challenge window. Specifically, the current epoch must be
at least 2 before the challenge epoch `t*`. -/

/-- `finished` from Figure 3: a party's state can be safely revealed once
its epoch counter reaches `t* + Δ`. -/
