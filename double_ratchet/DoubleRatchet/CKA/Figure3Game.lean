# Figure 3: CKA Security Game (Oracle-Based)

Paper-faithful formalization of Figure 3 from Alwen-Coretti-Dodis (2020)
"The Double Ratchet: Security Notions, Proofs, and Modularization for the
Signal Protocol."

## Game structure (Figure 3)

The adversary interacts adaptively with the following oracles:

- `send-P`: honest send for party P, returns `(T, I)` (message + output key)
- `send-P'(r)`: send with adversary-chosen randomness (requires `allow-corr`)
- `receive-P`: deliver pending message to party P, updates state
- `chall-P`: challenge send at epoch `t*`, returns `(T, I_b)` where `b` is hidden
- `corr-P`: reveal current state of party P (requires corruption permission)

## Corruption predicates

- `allow-corr ⟺ max(t_A, t_B) + 2 ≤ t*` (before challenge window)
- `finished_P ⟺ t_P ≥ t* + Δ` (after healing)
- Corruption permitted when `allow-corr ∨ finished_P`

## Adversary model

The adversary is an `OracleComp` client of the game oracles, following
VCV-io's standard oracle-interaction pattern (cf. PRF, PRFTagReader).
This is the adaptive model from the paper, replacing the restricted
non-adaptive transcript adversary in `MultiEpochGame.lean`.

## Ping-pong ordering

Parties alternate: A sends → B receives → B sends → A receives → ...
Enforced via `GamePhase` in the challenger state. Invalid queries
return `none` with state unchanged, modeling the paper's `req` guards
as failed oracle calls (the adversary continues querying).

## End-of-game condition

The paper says the game ends (not made explicit) once both parties'
states have been revealed after the challenge phase. Tracked via
`corruptedPostChalA` and `corruptedPostChalB` in the game state:
when both are set and `challengeUsed` is true, all oracle handlers
return `none`.
